Simple button for toggling idleness-watcher (LXQt Desktop)
===============
Adds a simple bash script to the system that allows to activate/disactivate the idleness watcher with one click or one command (type in a terminal window "toggle-idleness").
Add a quicklauch plugin to your panel and drag and drop "Idleness watcher" from the menu to it.

For install  run ./install_all.sh with root privileges.
